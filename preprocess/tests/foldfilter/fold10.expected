 Everyone 
is 
permitted 
to copy 
and 
distribute
 verbatim 
copies
 of this

but 
changing 
it is not 
allowed.

          
          
        Pr
eamble

  The GNU 
General 
Public 
License 
is a free,
 copyleft 
license 
for
software 
and other 
kinds of 
works.

  The 
licenses 
for most 
software 
and other 
practical 
works are 
designed
to take 
away your 
freedom 
to share 
and 
change 
the 
works.  
By 
contrast,
the GNU 
General 
Public 
License 
is 
intended 
to 
guarantee 
your 
freedom 
to
share and 
change 
all 
versions 
of a 
program--
to make 
sure it 
remains 
free
software 
for all 
its 
users.  
We, 
the Free 
Software 
Foundation
, use the
GNU 
General 
Public 
License 
for most 
of our 
software; 
it 
applies 
also to
any other 
work 
released 
this way 
by its 
authors.  
You can 
apply it 
to
your 
programs, 
too.

  When we 
speak of 
free 
software, 
we are 
referring 
to 
freedom, 
not
price.  
Our 
General 
Public 
Licenses 
are 
designed 
to make 
sure that 
you
have the 
freedom 
to 
distribute
 copies 
of free 
software 
(and 
charge 
for
them if 
you wish),
 that you 
receive 
source 
code or 
can get 
it if you
want it, 
that you 
can 
change 
the 
software 
or use 
pieces of 
it in new
free 
programs, 
and that 
you know 
you can 
do these 
things.

  To 
protect 
your 
rights, 
we need 
to 
prevent 
others 
from 
denying 
you
these 
rights or 
asking 
you to 
surrender 
the 
rights.  
Therefore,
 you have
certain 
responsibi
lities if 
you 
distribute
 copies 
of the 
software, 
or if
you 
modify it:
 responsib
ilities 
to 
respect 
the 
freedom 
of 
others.

  For 
example, 
if you 
distribute
 copies 
of such a 
program, 
whether
gratis or 
for a fee,
 you must 
pass on 
to the 
recipients
 the same
freedoms 
that you 
received. 
 You must 
make sure 
that they,
 too, 
receive
or can 
get the 
source 
code.  
And you 
must show 
them 
these 
terms so 
they
know 
their 
rights.

  Develope
rs that 
use the 
GNU GPL 
protect 
your 
rights 
with two 
steps:
(1) 
assert 
copyright 
on the 
software, 
and (2) 
offer you 
this 
License
giving 
you legal 
permission
 to copy, 
distribute
 and/or 
modify 
it.

  For the 
developers
' and 
authors' 
protection
, the GPL 
clearly 
explains
that 
there is 
no 
warranty 
for this 
free 
software. 
 For both 
users' 
and
authors' 
sake, 
the GPL 
requires 
that 
modified 
versions 
be marked 
as
changed, 
so that 
their 
problems 
will not 
be 
attributed
 erroneous
ly to
authors 
of 
previous 
versions.

  Some 
devices 
are 
designed 
to deny 
users 
access to 
install 
or run
modified 
versions 
of the 
software 
inside 
them, 
although 
the 
manufactur
er
can do 
so.  This 
is 
fundamenta
lly 
incompatib
le with 
the aim 
of
protecting
 users' 
freedom 
to change 
the 
software. 
 The 
systematic
pattern 
of such 
abuse 
occurs in 
the area 
of 
products 
for 
individual
s to
use, 
which is 
precisely 
where it 
is most 
unacceptab
le.  
Therefore,
 we
have 
designed 
this 
version 
of the 
GPL to 
prohibit 
the 
practice 
for those
products. 
 If such 
problems 
arise 
substantia
lly in 
other 
domains, 
we
stand 
ready to 
extend 
this 
provision 
to those 
domains 
in future 
versions
of the 
GPL, 
as needed 
to 
protect 
the 
freedom 
of users.

  Finally,
 every 
program 
is 
threatened
 constantl
y by 
software 
patents.
States 
should 
not allow 
patents 
to 
restrict 
developmen
t and use 
of
software 
on 
general-
purpose 
computers,
 but in 
those 
that do, 
we wish 
to
avoid the 
special 
danger 
that 
patents 
applied 
to a free 
program 
could
make it 
effectivel
y 
proprietar
y.  To 
prevent 
this, 
the GPL 
assures 
that
patents 
cannot be 
used to 
render 
the 
program 
non-free.

  The 
precise 
terms and 
conditions
 for 
copying, 
distributi
on and
modificati
on 
follow.

          
          
   TERMS 
AND 
CONDITIONS

  0. 
Definition
s.

  "This 
License" 
refers to 
version 3 
of the 
GNU 
General 
Public 
License.

  "Copyrig
ht" also 
means 
copyright-
like laws 
that 
apply to 
other 
kinds of
works, 
such as 
semiconduc
tor 
masks.

  "The 
Program" 
refers to 
any 
copyrighta
ble work 
licensed 
under 
this
License.  
Each 
licensee 
is 
addressed 
as "you". 
 "Licensee
s" and
"recipient
s" may be 
individual
s or 
organizati
ons.

  To 
"modify" 
a work 
means to 
copy from 
or adapt 
all or 
part of 
the work
in a 
fashion 
requiring 
copyright 
permission
, other 
than the 
making of 
an
exact 
copy.  
The 
resulting 
work is 
called a 
"modified 
version" 
of the
earlier 
work or a 
work 
"based 
on" the 
earlier 
work.

  A 
"covered 
work" 
means 
either 
the 
unmodified
 Program 
or a work 
based
on the 
Program.

  To 
"propagate
" a work 
means to 
do 
anything 
with it 
that, 
without
permission
, would 
make you 
directly 
or 
secondaril
y liable 
for
infringeme
nt under 
applicable
 copyright
 law, 
except 
executing 
it on a
computer 
or 
modifying 
a private 
copy.  
Propagatio
n 
includes 
copying,
distributi
on (with 
or 
without 
modificati
on), 
making 
available 
to the
public, 
and in 
some 
countries 
other 
activities
 as well.

  To 
"convey" 
a work 
means any 
kind of 
propagatio
n that 
enables 
other
parties 
to make 
or 
receive 
copies.  
Mere 
interactio
n with a 
user 
through
a 
computer 
network, 
with no 
transfer 
of a copy,
 is not 
conveying.

  An 
interactiv
e user 
interface 
displays 
"Appropria
te Legal 
Notices"
to the 
extent 
that it 
includes 
a 
convenient
 and 
prominentl
y visible
feature 
that (1) 
displays 
an 
appropriat
e 
copyright 
notice, 
and (2)
tells the 
user that 
there is 
no 
warranty 
for the 
work 
(except 
to the
extent 
that 
warranties
 are 
provided),
 that 
licensees 
may 
convey 
the
work 
under 
this 
License, 
and how 
to view a 
copy of 
this 
License.  
If
the 
interface 
presents 
a list of 
user 
commands 
or 
options, 
such as a
menu, 
a 
prominent 
item in 
the list 
meets 
this 
criterion.

  1. 
Source 
Code.

  The 
"source 
code" for 
a work 
means the 
preferred 
form of 
the work
for 
making 
modificati
ons to 
it.  
"Object 
code" 
means any 
non-
source
form of a 
work.

  A 
"Standard 
Interface"
 means an 
interface 
that 
either is 
an 
official
standard 
defined 
by a 
recognized
 standards
 body, or,
 in the 
case of
interfaces
 specified
 for a 
particular
 programmi
ng 
language, 
one that
is widely 
used 
among 
developers
 working 
in that 
language.

  The 
"System 
Libraries"
 of an 
executable
 work 
include 
anything, 
other
than the 
work as a 
whole, 
that (a) 
is 
included 
in the 
normal 
form of
packaging 
a Major 
Component,
 but 
which is 
not part 
of that 
Major
Component,
 and (b) 
serves 
only to 
enable 
use of 
the work 
with that
Major 
Component,
 or to 
implement 
a 
Standard 
Interface 
for which 
an
implementa
tion is 
available 
to the 
public in 
source 
code 
form.  A
"Major 
Component"
, in this 
context, 
means a 
major 
essential 
component
(kernel, 
window 
system, 
and so 
on) of 
the 
specific 
operating 
system
(if any) 
on which 
the 
executable
 work 
runs, 
or a 
compiler 
used to
produce 
the work, 
or an 
object 
code 
interprete
r used to 
run it.

  The 
"Correspon
ding 
Source" 
for a 
work in 
object 
code form 
means all
the 
source 
code 
needed to 
generate, 
install, 
and (for 
an 
executable
work) run 
the 
object 
code and 
to modify 
the work, 
including 
scripts 
to
control 
those 
activities
.  However
, it does 
not 
include 
the 
work's
System 
Libraries,
 or 
general-
purpose 
tools or 
generally 
available 
free
programs 
which are 
used 
unmodified
 in 
performing
 those 
activities
 but
which are 
not part 
of the 
work.  
For 
example, 
Correspond
ing 
Source
includes 
interface 
definition
 files 
associated
 with 
source 
files for
the work, 
and the 
source 
code for 
shared 
libraries 
and 
dynamicall
y
linked 
subprogram
s that 
the work 
is 
specifical
ly 
designed 
to 
require,
such as 
by 
intimate 
data 
communicat
ion or 
control 
flow 
between 
those
subprogram
s and 
other 
parts of 
the work.

  The 
Correspond
ing 
Source 
need not 
include 
anything 
that 
users
can 
regenerate
 automatic
ally from 
other 
parts of 
the 
Correspond
ing
Source.

  The 
Correspond
ing 
Source 
for a 
work in 
source 
code form 
is that
same 
work.

  2. 
Basic 
Permission
s.

  All 
rights 
granted 
under 
this 
License 
are 
granted 
for the 
term of
copyright 
on the 
Program, 
and are 
irrevocabl
e 
provided 
the 
stated
conditions
 are met. 
 This 
License 
explicitly
 affirms 
your 
unlimited
permission
 to run 
the 
unmodified
 Program. 
 The 
output 
from 
running a
covered 
work is 
covered 
by this 
License 
only if 
the 
output, 
given its
content, 
constitute
s a 
covered 
work.  
This 
License 
acknowledg
es your
rights of 
fair use 
or other 
equivalent
, as 
provided 
by 
copyright 
law.

  You may 
make, 
run and 
propagate 
covered 
works 
that you 
do not
convey, 
without 
conditions
 so long 
as your 
license 
otherwise 
remains
in force. 
 You may 
convey 
covered 
works to 
others 
for the 
sole 
purpose
of having 
them make 
modificati
ons 
exclusivel
y for you,
 or 
provide 
you
with 
facilities
 for 
running 
those 
works, 
provided 
that you 
comply 
with
the terms 
of this 
License 
in 
conveying 
all 
material 
for which 
you do
not 
control 
copyright.
  Those 
thus 
making or 
running 
the 
covered 
works
for you 
must do 
so 
exclusivel
y on your 
behalf, 
under 
your 
direction
and 
control, 
on terms 
that 
prohibit 
them from 
making 
any 
copies of
your 
copyrighte
d 
material 
outside 
their 
relationsh
ip with 
you.

  Conveyin
g under 
any other 
circumstan
ces is 
permitted 
solely 
under
the 
conditions
 stated 
below.  
Sublicensi
ng is not 
allowed; 
section 
10
makes it 
unnecessar
y.

  3. 
Protecting
 Users' 
Legal 
Rights 
From 
Anti-
Circumvent
ion Law.

  No 
covered 
work 
shall be 
deemed 
part of 
an 
effective 
technologi
cal
measure 
under any 
applicable
 law 
fulfilling
 obligatio
ns under 
article
11 of the 
WIPO 
copyright 
treaty 
adopted 
on 20 
December 
1996, or
similar 
laws 
prohibitin
g or 
restrictin
g 
circumvent
ion of 
such
measures.

  When 
you 
convey a 
covered 
work, 
you waive 
any legal 
power to 
forbid
circumvent
ion of 
technologi
cal 
measures 
to the 
extent 
such 
circumvent
ion
is 
effected 
by 
exercising
 rights 
under 
this 
License 
with 
respect 
to
the 
covered 
work, 
and you 
disclaim 
any 
intention 
to limit 
operation 
or
modificati
on of the 
work as a 
means of 
enforcing,
 against 
the 
work's
users, 
your or 
third 
parties' 
legal 
rights to 
forbid 
circumvent
ion of
technologi
cal 
measures.

  4. 
Conveying 
Verbatim 
Copies.

  You may 
convey 
verbatim 
copies of 
the 
Program's 
source 
code as 
you
receive 
it, 
in any 
medium, 
provided 
that you 
conspicuou
sly and
appropriat
ely 
publish 
on each 
copy an 
appropriat
e 
copyright 
notice;
keep 
intact 
all 
notices 
stating 
that this 
License 
and any
non-
permissive
 terms 
added in 
accord 
with 
section 7 
apply to 
the code;
keep 
intact 
all 
notices 
of the 
absence 
of any 
warranty; 
and give 
all
recipients
 a copy 
of this 
License 
along 
with the 
Program.

  You may 
charge 
any price 
or no 
price for 
each copy 
that you 
convey,
and you 
may offer 
support 
or 
warranty 
protection
 for a 
fee.

  5. 
Conveying 
Modified 
Source 
Versions.

  You may 
convey a 
work 
based on 
the 
Program, 
or the 
modificati
ons to
produce 
it from 
the 
Program, 
in the 
form of 
source 
code 
under the
terms of 
section 4,
 provided 
that you 
also meet 
all of 
these 
conditions
:

    a) 
The work 
must 
carry 
prominent 
notices 
stating 
that you 
modified
    it, 
and 
giving a 
relevant 
date.

    b) 
The work 
must 
carry 
prominent 
notices 
stating 
that it 
is
    releas
ed under 
this 
License 
and any 
conditions
 added 
under 
section
    7.  
This 
requiremen
t 
modifies 
the 
requiremen
t in 
section 4 
to
    "keep 
intact 
all 
notices".

    c) 
You must 
license 
the 
entire 
work, 
as a 
whole, 
under 
this
    Licens
e to 
anyone 
who comes 
into 
possession
 of a 
copy.  
This
    Licens
e will 
therefore 
apply, 
along 
with any 
applicable
 section 
7
    additi
onal 
terms, 
to the 
whole of 
the work, 
and all 
its parts,
    regard
less of 
how they 
are 
packaged. 
 This 
License 
gives no
    permis
sion to 
license 
the work 
in any 
other way,
 but it 
does not
    invali
date such 
permission
 if you 
have 
separately
 received 
it.

    d) If 
the work 
has 
interactiv
e user 
interfaces
, each 
must 
display
    Approp
riate 
Legal 
Notices; 
however, 
if the 
Program 
has 
interactiv
e
    interf
aces that 
do not 
display 
Appropriat
e Legal 
Notices, 
your
    work 
need not 
make them 
do so.

  A 
compilatio
n of a 
covered 
work with 
other 
separate 
and 
independen
t
works, 
which are 
not by 
their 
nature 
extensions
 of the 
covered 
work,
and which 
are not 
combined 
with it 
such as 
to form a 
larger 
program,
in or on 
a volume 
of a 
storage 
or 
distributi
on medium,
 is 
called an
"aggregate
" if the 
compilatio
n and its 
resulting 
copyright 
are not
used to 
limit the 
access or 
legal 
rights of 
the 
compilatio
n's users
beyond 
what the 
individual
 works 
permit.  
Inclusion 
of a 
covered 
work
in an 
aggregate 
does not 
cause 
this 
License 
to apply 
to the 
other
parts of 
the 
aggregate.

  6. 
Conveying 
Non-
Source 
Forms.

  You may 
convey a 
covered 
work in 
object 
code form 
under the 
terms
of 
sections 
4 and 5, 
provided 
that you 
also 
convey 
the
machine-
readable 
Correspond
ing 
Source 
under the 
terms of 
this 
License,
in one of 
these 
ways:

    a) 
Convey 
the 
object 
code in, 
or 
embodied 
in, 
a 
physical 
product
    (inclu
ding a 
physical 
distributi
on 
medium), 
accompanie
d by the
    Corres
ponding 
Source 
fixed on 
a durable 
physical 
medium
    custom
arily 
used for 
software 
interchang
e.

    b) 
Convey 
the 
object 
code in, 
or 
embodied 
in, 
a 
physical 
product
    (inclu
ding a 
physical 
distributi
on 
medium), 
accompanie
d by a
    writte
n offer, 
valid for 
at least 
three 
years and 
valid for 
as
    long 
as you 
offer 
spare 
parts or 
customer 
support 
for that 
product
    model,
 to give 
anyone 
who 
possesses 
the 
object 
code 
either 
(1) a
    copy 
of the 
Correspond
ing 
Source 
for all 
the 
software 
in the
    produc
t that is 
covered 
by this 
License, 
on a 
durable 
physical
    medium
 customari
ly used 
for 
software 
interchang
e, 
for a 
price no
    more 
than your 
reasonable
 cost of 
physically
 performin
g this
    convey
ing of 
source, 
or (2) 
access to 
copy the
    Corres
ponding 
Source 
from a 
network 
server at 
no 
charge.

    c) 
Convey 
individual
 copies 
of the 
object 
code with 
a copy of 
the
    writte
n offer 
to 
provide 
the 
Correspond
ing 
Source.  
This
    altern
ative is 
allowed 
only 
occasional
ly and 
noncommerc
ially, 
and
    only 
if you 
received 
the 
object 
code with 
such an 
offer, 
in accord
    with 
subsection
 6b.

    d) 
Convey 
the 
object 
code by 
offering 
access 
from a 
designated
    place 
(gratis 
or for a 
charge), 
and offer 
equivalent
 access 
to the
    Corres
ponding 
Source in 
the same 
way 
through 
the same 
place at 
no
    furthe
r charge. 
 You need 
not 
require 
recipients
 to copy 
the
    Corres
ponding 
Source 
along 
with the 
object 
code.  If 
the place 
to
    copy 
the 
object 
code is a 
network 
server, 
the 
Correspond
ing 
Source
    may 
be on a 
different 
server 
(operated 
by you or 
a third 
party)
    that 
supports 
equivalent
 copying 
facilities
, provided
 you 
maintain
    clear 
directions
 next to 
the 
object 
code 
saying 
where to 
find the
    Corres
ponding 
Source.  
Regardless
 of what 
server 
hosts the
    Corres
ponding 
Source, 
you 
remain 
obligated 
to ensure 
that it 
is
    availa
ble for 
as long 
as needed 
to 
satisfy 
these 
requiremen
ts.

    e) 
Convey 
the 
object 
code 
using 
peer-to-
peer 
transmissi
on, 
provided
    you 
inform 
other 
peers 
where the 
object 
code and 
Correspond
ing
    Source
 of the 
work are 
being 
offered 
to the 
general 
public at 
no
    charge
 under 
subsection
 6d.

  A 
separable 
portion 
of the 
object 
code, 
whose 
source 
code is 
excluded
from the 
Correspond
ing 
Source as 
a System 
Library, 
need not 
be
included 
in 
conveying 
the 
object 
code 
work.

  A "User 
Product" 
is either 
(1) a 
"consumer 
product", 
which 
means any
tangible 
personal 
property 
which is 
normally 
used for 
personal, 
family,
or 
household 
purposes, 
or (2) 
anything 
designed 
or sold 
for 
incorporat
ion
into a 
dwelling. 
 In 
determinin
g whether 
a product 
is a 
consumer 
product,
doubtful 
cases 
shall be 
resolved 
in favor 
of 
coverage. 
 For a 
particular
product 
received 
by a 
particular
 user, 
"normally 
used" 
refers to 
a
typical 
or common 
use of 
that 
class of 
product, 
regardless
 of the 
status
of the 
particular
 user or 
of the 
way in 
which the 
particular
 user
actually 
uses, 
or 
expects 
or is 
expected 
to use, 
the 
product.  
A product
is a 
consumer 
product 
regardless
 of 
whether 
the 
product 
has 
substantia
l
commercial
, industri
al or 
non-
consumer 
uses, 
unless 
such uses 
represent
the only 
significan
t mode of 
use of 
the 
product.

  "Install
ation 
Informatio
n" for a 
User 
Product 
means any 
methods,
procedures
, authoriz
ation 
keys, 
or other 
informatio
n 
required 
to 
install
and 
execute 
modified 
versions 
of a 
covered 
work in 
that User 
Product 
from
a 
modified 
version 
of its 
Correspond
ing 
Source.  
The 
informatio
n must
suffice 
to ensure 
that the 
continued 
functionin
g of the 
modified 
object
code is 
in no 
case 
prevented 
or 
interfered
 with 
solely 
because
modificati
on has 
been 
made.

  If you 
convey an 
object 
code work 
under 
this 
section 
in, 
or with, 
or
specifical
ly for 
use in, 
a User 
Product, 
and the 
conveying 
occurs as
part of a 
transactio
n in 
which the 
right of 
possession
 and use 
of the
User 
Product 
is 
transferre
d to the 
recipient 
in 
perpetuity
 or for a
fixed 
term 
(regardles
s of how 
the 
transactio
n is 
characteri
zed), the
Correspond
ing 
Source 
conveyed 
under 
this 
section 
must be 
accompanie
d
by the 
Installati
on 
Informatio
n.  But 
this 
requiremen
t does 
not apply
if 
neither 
you nor 
any third 
party 
retains 
the 
ability 
to 
install
modified 
object 
code on 
the User 
Product 
(for 
example, 
the work 
has
been 
installed 
in ROM).

  The 
requiremen
t to 
provide 
Installati
on 
Informatio
n does 
not 
include a
requiremen
t to 
continue 
to 
provide 
support 
service, 
warranty, 
or 
updates
for a 
work that 
has been 
modified 
or 
installed 
by the 
recipient,
 or for
the User 
Product 
in which 
it has 
been 
modified 
or 
installed.
  Access 
to a
network 
may be 
denied 
when the 
modificati
on itself 
materially
 and
adversely 
affects 
the 
operation 
of the 
network 
or 
violates 
the rules 
and
protocols 
for 
communicat
ion 
across 
the 
network.

  Correspo
nding 
Source 
conveyed, 
and 
Installati
on 
Informatio
n 
provided,
in accord 
with this 
section 
must be 
in a 
format 
that is 
publicly
documented
 (and 
with an 
implementa
tion 
available 
to the 
public in
source 
code 
form), 
and must 
require 
no 
special 
password 
or key 
for
unpacking,
 reading 
or 
copying.

  7. 
Additional
 Terms.

  "Additio
nal 
permission
s" are 
terms 
that 
supplement
 the 
terms of 
this
License 
by making 
exceptions
 from one 
or more 
of its 
conditions
.
Additional
 permissio
ns that 
are 
applicable
 to the 
entire 
Program 
shall
be 
treated 
as though 
they were 
included 
in this 
License, 
to the 
extent
that they 
are valid 
under 
applicable
 law.  If 
additional
 permissio
ns
apply 
only to 
part of 
the 
Program, 
that part 
may be 
used 
separately
under 
those 
permission
s, 
but the 
entire 
Program 
remains 
governed 
by
this 
License 
without 
regard to 
the 
additional
 permissio
ns.

  When 
you 
convey a 
copy of a 
covered 
work, 
you may 
at your 
option
remove 
any 
additional
 permissio
ns from 
that copy,
 or from 
any part 
of
it.  
(Additiona
l 
permission
s may be 
written 
to 
require 
their own
removal 
in 
certain 
cases 
when you 
modify 
the 
work.)  
You may 
place
additional
 permissio
ns on 
material, 
added by 
you to a 
covered 
work,
for which 
you have 
or can 
give 
appropriat
e 
copyright 
permission
.

  Notwiths
tanding 
any other 
provision 
of this 
License, 
for 
material 
you
add to a 
covered 
work, 
you may 
(if 
authorized
 by the 
copyright 
holders 
of
that 
material) 
supplement
 the 
terms of 
this 
License 
with 
terms:

    a) 
Disclaimin
g 
warranty 
or 
limiting 
liability 
differentl
y from 
the
    terms 
of 
sections 
15 and 16 
of this 
License; 
or

    b) 
Requiring 
preservati
on of 
specified 
reasonable
 legal 
notices 
or
    author
 attributi
ons in 
that 
material 
or in the 
Appropriat
e Legal
    Notice
s 
displayed 
by works 
containing
 it; or

    c) 
Prohibitin
g 
misreprese
ntation 
of the 
origin of 
that 
material, 
or
    requir
ing that 
modified 
versions 
of such 
material 
be marked 
in
    reason
able ways 
as 
different 
from the 
original 
version; 
or

    d) 
Limiting 
the use 
for 
publicity 
purposes 
of names 
of 
licensors 
or
    author
s of the 
material; 
or

    e) 
Declining 
to grant 
rights 
under 
trademark 
law for 
use of 
some
    trade 
names, 
trademarks
, or 
service 
marks; or

    f) 
Requiring 
indemnific
ation of 
licensors 
and 
authors 
of that
    materi
al by 
anyone 
who 
conveys 
the 
material 
(or 
modified 
versions 
of
    it) 
with 
contractua
l 
assumption
s of 
liability 
to the 
recipient,
 for
    any 
liability 
that 
these 
contractua
l 
assumption
s 
directly 
impose on
    those 
licensors 
and 
authors.

  All 
other 
non-
permissive
 additiona
l terms 
are 
considered
 "further
restrictio
ns" 
within 
the 
meaning 
of 
section 
10.  If 
the 
Program 
as you
received 
it, 
or any 
part of 
it, 
contains 
a notice 
stating 
that it 
is
governed 
by this 
License 
along 
with a 
term that 
is a 
further
restrictio
n, 
you may 
remove 
that 
term.  If 
a license 
document 
contains
a further 
restrictio
n but 
permits 
relicensin
g or 
conveying 
under 
this
License, 
you may 
add to a 
covered 
work 
material 
governed 
by the 
terms
of that 
license 
document, 
provided 
that the 
further 
restrictio
n does
not 
survive 
such 
relicensin
g or 
conveying.

  If you 
add terms 
to a 
covered 
work in 
accord 
with this 
section, 
you
must 
place, 
in the 
relevant 
source 
files, 
a 
statement 
of the
additional
 terms 
that 
apply to 
those 
files, 
or a 
notice 
indicating
where to 
find the 
applicable
 terms.

  Addition
al terms, 
permissive
 or 
non-
permissive
, may be 
stated in 
the
form of a 
separately
 written 
license, 
or stated 
as 
exceptions
;
the above 
requiremen
ts apply 
either 
way.

  8. 
Terminatio
n.

  You may 
not 
propagate 
or modify 
a covered 
work 
except as 
expressly
provided 
under 
this 
License.  
Any 
attempt 
otherwise 
to 
propagate 
or
modify it 
is void, 
and will 
automatica
lly 
terminate 
your 
rights 
under
this 
License 
(including
 any 
patent 
licenses 
granted 
under the 
third
paragraph 
of 
section 
11).

  However,
 if you 
cease all 
violation 
of this 
License, 
then your
license 
from a 
particular
 copyright
 holder 
is 
reinstated
 (a)
provisiona
lly, 
unless 
and until 
the 
copyright 
holder 
explicitly
 and
finally 
terminates
 your 
license, 
and (b) 
permanentl
y, 
if the 
copyright
holder 
fails to 
notify 
you of 
the 
violation 
by some 
reasonable
 means
prior to 
60 days 
after the 
cessation.

  Moreover
, your 
license 
from a 
particular
 copyright
 holder 
is
reinstated
 permanent
ly if the 
copyright 
holder 
notifies 
you of 
the
violation 
by some 
reasonable
 means, 
this is 
the first 
time you 
have
received 
notice of 
violation 
of this 
License 
(for any 
work) 
from that
copyright 
holder, 
and you 
cure the 
violation 
prior to 
30 days 
after
your 
receipt 
of the 
notice.

  Terminat
ion of 
your 
rights 
under 
this 
section 
does not 
terminate 
the
licenses 
of 
parties 
who have 
received 
copies or 
rights 
from you 
under
this 
License.  
If your 
rights 
have been 
terminated
 and not 
permanentl
y
reinstated
, you do 
not 
qualify 
to 
receive 
new 
licenses 
for the 
same
material 
under 
section 
10.

  9. 
Acceptance
 Not 
Required 
for 
Having 
Copies.

  You are 
not 
required 
to accept 
this 
License 
in order 
to 
receive 
or
run a 
copy of 
the 
Program.  
Ancillary 
propagatio
n of a 
covered 
work
occurring 
solely as 
a 
consequenc
e of 
using 
peer-to-
peer 
transmissi
on
to 
receive a 
copy 
likewise 
does not 
require 
acceptance
.  However
,
nothing 
other 
than this 
License 
grants 
you 
permission
 to 
propagate 
or
modify 
any 
covered 
work.  
These 
actions 
infringe 
copyright 
if you do
not 
accept 
this 
License.  
Therefore,
 by 
modifying 
or 
propagatin
g a
covered 
work, 
you 
indicate 
your 
acceptance
 of this 
License 
to do so.

  10. 
Automatic 
Licensing 
of 
Downstream
 Recipient
s.

  Each 
time you 
convey a 
covered 
work, 
the 
recipient 
automatica
lly
receives 
a license 
from the 
original 
licensors,
 to run, 
modify 
and
propagate 
that work,
 subject 
to this 
License.  
You are 
not 
responsibl
e
for 
enforcing 
compliance
 by third 
parties 
with this 
License.

  An 
"entity 
transactio
n" is a 
transactio
n 
transferri
ng 
control 
of an
organizati
on, 
or 
substantia
lly all 
assets of 
one, 
or 
subdividin
g an
organizati
on, 
or 
merging 
organizati
ons.  If 
propagatio
n of a 
covered
work 
results 
from an 
entity 
transactio
n, 
each 
party to 
that
transactio
n who 
receives 
a copy of 
the work 
also 
receives 
whatever
licenses 
to the 
work the 
party's 
predecesso
r in 
interest 
had or 
could
give 
under the 
previous 
paragraph,
 plus a 
right to 
possession
 of the
Correspond
ing 
Source of 
the work 
from the 
predecesso
r in 
interest, 
if
the 
predecesso
r has it 
or can 
get it 
with 
reasonable
 efforts.

  You may 
not 
impose 
any 
further 
restrictio
ns on the 
exercise 
of the
rights 
granted 
or 
affirmed 
under 
this 
License.  
For 
example, 
you may
not 
impose a 
license 
fee, 
royalty, 
or other 
charge 
for 
exercise 
of
rights 
granted 
under 
this 
License, 
and you 
may not 
initiate 
litigation
(including
 a 
cross-
claim or 
countercla
im in a 
lawsuit) 
alleging 
that
any 
patent 
claim is 
infringed 
by making,
 using, 
selling, 
offering 
for
sale, 
or 
importing 
the 
Program 
or any 
portion 
of it.

  11. 
Patents.

  A 
"contribut
or" is a 
copyright 
holder 
who 
authorizes
 use 
under 
this
License 
of the 
Program 
or a work 
on which 
the 
Program 
is based. 
 The
work thus 
licensed 
is called 
the 
contributo
r's 
"contribut
or 
version".

  A 
contributo
r's 
"essential
 patent 
claims" 
are all 
patent 
claims
owned or 
controlled
 by the 
contributo
r, 
whether 
already 
acquired 
or
hereafter 
acquired, 
that 
would be 
infringed 
by some 
manner, 
permitted
by this 
License, 
of making,
 using, 
or 
selling 
its 
contributo
r version,
but do 
not 
include 
claims 
that 
would be 
infringed 
only as a
consequenc
e of 
further 
modificati
on of the 
contributo
r 
version.  
For
purposes 
of this 
definition
, "control
" 
includes 
the right 
to grant
patent 
sublicense
s in a 
manner 
consistent
 with the 
requiremen
ts of
this 
License.

  Each 
contributo
r grants 
you a 
non-
exclusive,
 worldwide
, royalty-
free
patent 
license 
under the 
contributo
r's 
essential 
patent 
claims, 
to
make, use,
 sell, 
offer for 
sale, 
import 
and 
otherwise 
run, 
modify 
and
propagate 
the 
contents 
of its 
contributo
r 
version.

  In the 
following 
three 
paragraphs
, a 
"patent 
license" 
is any 
express
agreement 
or 
commitment
, however 
denominate
d, 
not to 
enforce a 
patent
(such as 
an 
express 
permission
 to 
practice 
a patent 
or 
covenant 
not to
sue for 
patent 
infringeme
nt).  To 
"grant" 
such a 
patent 
license 
to a
party 
means to 
make such 
an 
agreement 
or 
commitment
 not to 
enforce a
patent 
against 
the 
party.

  If you 
convey a 
covered 
work, 
knowingly 
relying 
on a 
patent 
license,
and the 
Correspond
ing 
Source of 
the work 
is not 
available 
for 
anyone
to copy, 
free of 
charge 
and under 
the terms 
of this 
License, 
through a
publicly 
available 
network 
server or 
other 
readily 
accessible
 means,
then you 
must 
either 
(1) cause 
the 
Correspond
ing 
Source to 
be so
available,
 or (2) 
arrange 
to 
deprive 
yourself 
of the 
benefit 
of the
patent 
license 
for this 
particular
 work, 
or (3) 
arrange, 
in a 
manner
consistent
 with the 
requiremen
ts of 
this 
License, 
to extend 
the 
patent
license 
to 
downstream
 recipient
s.  
"Knowingly
 relying" 
means you 
have
actual 
knowledge 
that, 
but for 
the 
patent 
license, 
your 
conveying 
the
covered 
work in a 
country, 
or your 
recipient'
s use of 
the 
covered 
work
in a 
country, 
would 
infringe 
one or 
more 
identifiab
le 
patents 
in that
country 
that you 
have 
reason to 
believe 
are 
valid.

  If, 
pursuant 
to or in 
connection
 with a 
single 
transactio
n or
arrangemen
t, 
you 
convey, 
or 
propagate 
by 
procuring 
conveyance
 of, a
covered 
work, 
and grant 
a patent 
license 
to some 
of the 
parties
receiving 
the 
covered 
work 
authorizin
g them to 
use, 
propagate,
 modify
or convey 
a 
specific 
copy of 
the 
covered 
work, 
then the 
patent 
license
you grant 
is 
automatica
lly 
extended 
to all 
recipients
 of the 
covered
work and 
works 
based on 
it.

  A 
patent 
license 
is 
"discrimin
atory" if 
it does 
not 
include 
within
the scope 
of its 
coverage, 
prohibits 
the 
exercise 
of, or is
conditione
d on the 
non-
exercise 
of one or 
more of 
the 
rights 
that are
specifical
ly 
granted 
under 
this 
License.  
You may 
not 
convey a 
covered
work if 
you are a 
party to 
an 
arrangemen
t with a 
third 
party 
that is
in the 
business 
of 
distributi
ng 
software, 
under 
which you 
make 
payment
to the 
third 
party 
based on 
the 
extent of 
your 
activity 
of 
conveying
the work, 
and under 
which the 
third 
party 
grants, 
to any of 
the
parties 
who would 
receive 
the 
covered 
work from 
you, 
a 
discrimina
tory
patent 
license 
(a) in 
connection
 with 
copies of 
the 
covered 
work
conveyed 
by you 
(or 
copies 
made from 
those 
copies), 
or (b) 
primarily
for and 
in 
connection
 with 
specific 
products 
or 
compilatio
ns that
contain 
the 
covered 
work, 
unless 
you 
entered 
into that 
arrangemen
t,
or that 
patent 
license 
was 
granted, 
prior to 
28 March 
2007.

  Nothing 
in this 
License 
shall be 
construed 
as 
excluding 
or 
limiting
any 
implied 
license 
or other 
defenses 
to 
infringeme
nt that 
may
otherwise 
be 
available 
to you 
under 
applicable
 patent 
law.

  12. No 
Surrender

Others' 
Freedom.

  If 
conditions
 are 
imposed 
on you 
(whether 
by court 
order, 
agreement 
or
otherwise)
 that 
contradict
 the 
conditions
 of this 
License, 
they do 
not
excuse 
you from 
the 
conditions
 of this 
License.  
If you 
cannot 
convey a
covered 
work so 
as to 
satisfy 
simultaneo
usly your 
obligation
s under 
this
License 
and any 
other 
pertinent 
obligation
s, 
then as a 
consequenc
e you may
not 
convey it 
at all.  
For 
example, 
if you 
agree to 
terms 
that 
obligate 
you
to 
collect a 
royalty 
for 
further 
conveying 
from 
those to 
whom you 
convey
the 
Program, 
the only 
way you 
could 
satisfy 
both 
those 
terms and 
this
License 
would be 
to 
refrain 
entirely 
from 
conveying 
the 
Program.

  13. Use

GNU 
Affero 
General 
Public 
License.

  Notwiths
tanding 
any other 
provision 
of this 
License, 
you have
permission
 to link

combine 
any 
covered 
work with 
a work 
licensed
under 
version 3 
of the 
GNU 
Affero 
General 
Public 
License 
into a 
single
combined 
work, 
and to 
convey 
the 
resulting 
work.  
The terms 
of this
License 
will 
continue 
to apply 
to the 
part 
which is 
the 
covered 
work,
but the 
special 
requiremen
ts of the 
GNU 
Affero 
General 
Public 
License,
section 
13, 
concerning
 interacti

such.

Revised 
Versions 
of this 
License.

  The 
Free 
Software 
Foundation
 may 
publish 
revised 
and/or 
new 
versions 
of
the GNU 
General 
Public 
License 
from time 
to time.  
Such new 
versions 
will
be 
similar 
in spirit 
to the 
present 
version, 
but may 
differ in 
detail to
address 
new 
problems 
or 
concerns.

  Each 
version 
is given 
a 
distinguis
hing 
version 
number.  
If the
Program 
specifies 
that a 
certain 
numbered 
version 
of the 
GNU 
General
Public 
License 
"or any 
later 
version" 
applies 
to it, 
you have 
the
option of 
following 
the terms 
and 
conditions
 either 
of that 
numbered
version 
or of any 
later 
version 
published 
by the 
Free 
Software
Foundation
.  If the 
Program 
does not 
specify a 
version 
number of 
the
GNU 
General 
Public 
License, 
you may 
choose 
any 
version 
ever 
published
by the 
Free 
Software 
Foundation
.

  If the 
Program 
specifies 
that a 
proxy can 
decide 
which 
future
versions 
of the 
GNU 
General 
Public 
License 
can be 
used, 
that 
proxy's
public 
statement 
of 
acceptance
 of a 
version 
permanentl
y 
authorizes
 you
to choose 
that 
version 
for the 
Program.

  Later 
license 
versions 
may give 
you 
additional
 or 
different
permission
s.  
However, 
no 
additional
 obligatio
ns are 
imposed 
on any
author or 
copyright 
holder as 
a result 
of your 
choosing 
to follow 
a
later 
version.

  15.

 of

  THERE 
IS NO

WHEN 
OTHERWISE 
STATED IN

DEFECTIVE,
 YOU

  16. 
Limitation
 of 
Liability.

  IN NO 
EVENT 
UNLESS 
REQUIRED 
BY 
APPLICABLE
 LAW OR 
AGREED TO 
IN 
WRITING
WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT 
HOLDER, 
OR ANY 
OTHER 
PARTY WHO 
MODIFIES 
AND/OR 
CONVEYS
THE

AS 
PERMITTED 
ABOVE,

Sections 
15 and 
16.

  If the

 of

an 
absolute

  How to 
Apply 
These 
Terms to 
Your New 
Programs

  If you 
develop a 
new 
program, 
and you 
want it 
to be of 
the 
greatest
possible 
use to 
the 
public, 
the best 
way to 
achieve 
this is 
to make 
it
free 
software 
which 
everyone 
can 
redistribu
te and 
change 
under 
these 
terms.

  To do 
so, 
attach 
the 
following 
notices 
to the 
program.  
It is 
safest
to attach 
them to 
the start 
of each 
source 
file to 
most 
effectivel
y
state the 
exclusion 
of 
warranty; 
and each 
file 
should 
have at 
least
the 
"copyright
" line 
and a 
pointer 
to where 
the full 
notice is 
found.

    <one 
line to 
give the 
program's 
name and 
a brief 
idea of 
what it 
does.>

    This

License 
as 
published 
by
    the 
Free 
Software 
Foundation
, either 
version 3 
of the

or
    (at 
your 
option) 
any later 
version.

    This

is

it will 
be useful,
    but

 See the
    GNU

for more

    You 
should 
have

a copy of

    along

If not, 
see <http:

Also add 
informatio
n on how 
to 
contact 
you by 
electronic
 and 
paper 
mail.

  If the 
program 
does 
terminal 
interactio
n, 
make it 
output a 
short
notice 
like this 
when it 
starts in 
an 
interactiv
e mode:

    <progr
am>  
Copyright 
(C) 
<year>  
<name of

    This 
program 
comes 
with 
ABSOLUTELY
 NO 
WARRANTY; 
for 
details 
type 
`show w'.
    This 
is free 
software, 
and you 
are 
welcome 
to 
redistribu
te it
    under 
certain 
conditions
; type 
`show c' 
for 
details.

The 
hypothetic
al 
commands 
`show w' 
and `show 
c' should 
show the 
appropriat
e
parts of 
the 
General 
Public 
License.  
Of course,
 your 
program's 
commands
might be 
different;
 for a 
GUI 
interface,
 you 
would use 
an "about 
box".

  You 
should 
also get 
your 
employer 
(if you 
work as a 
programmer
) or 
school,
if any, 
to sign a 
"copyright
 disclaime
r" for 
the 
program, 
if 
necessary.

  The GNU

incorporat

 If your

is a

you
may 
consider 
it more 
useful to 
permit 
linking 
proprietar
